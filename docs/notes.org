#+TITLE: C950 - General Notes
#+AUTHOR: Ray Perry

* Captures
- 3 trucks
- 2 drivers
- 40 packages

** TODO All packages must be delivered on time in the least number of miles

- Expected delivery time for each package
- All information can change at will
- Manager should be able to see progress and KPIs of each truck
- Detailed comments and justify decisions made when writing (gross)

* Assumptions
-  Each truck can carry a maximum of 16 packages.
-  Trucks travel at an average speed of 18 miles per hour.
-  Trucks have a “infinite amount of gas” with no need to stop.
-  Each driver stays with the same truck as long as that truck is in service.
-  Drivers leave the hub at 8:00 a.m., with the truck loaded, and can return to the hub for packages if needed. The day ends when all 40 packages have been delivered.
-  Delivery time is instantaneous, i.e., no time passes while at a delivery (that time is factored into the average speed of the trucks).
-  There is up to one special note for each package.
-  The wrong delivery address for package #9, Third District Juvenile Court, will be corrected at 10:20 a.m. The correct address is 410 S State St., Salt Lake City, UT 84111.
-  The package ID is unique; there are no collisions.
-  No further assumptions exist or are allowed.

* Refiling
** Driver
** Truck
   - 3 in total
   - Holds 1 driver (and 2 passengers, if necessary)
   - Carries a maximum of 16 packages
   - Travel at an average speed of 18 mph
   - Have infinite amount of gas; no need to stop
   - Same driver per truck
   - Drivers start at 0800 with loaded trucks; can return if necessary
   - Delivery is instantaneous
** Package
   - Each package may have a special note
   - Package #9 has a wrong address; will be corrected at 1020 to 410 S State St., Salt Lake City, UT 84111
   - Package IDs are unique

* Thoughts
All right, let's see what this nonsense is about.

Looks like I'll need to make some kind of game loop. Might be able to get away with a timer and an update method.

I should convert the files into CSVs first; I'm not parsing over an XLSX.

Looks like the rub is gonna happen at 1020. Do I really have to figure out pathfinding here? Might need a graph.

No problem, this is something you do intuitively. Just need to learn Python and put it into Python now.

* Steps
** TODO Figure out how complex this problem really is
** TODO Convert the base files into CSVs
** TODO Determine which data structures to use
** [0/5] Create classes for the entities
*** TODO Driver
*** TODO Manager
*** TODO Package
*** TODO Truck
*** TODO Destination
** [0/2] Create simple game loop
*** TODO Timer
*** TODO Update Function
